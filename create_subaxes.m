function [ax,f] = create_subaxes(fignum,m,n,p)
% Clear out a specified figure and create a clean set of axes in that
% figure with equal-axis aspect ratio

% Input:
%
%   fignum: The number of the figure (or a figure handle) in which to
%       create the axes 
%   m: the number of rows of subplots to create
%   n: the number of columns of subplots to create
%   p: the number of subplots to create (should be less than or equal to
%       m*n)
%
% Outputs:
%
%   ax: A cell array of handles to the created subplot axes
%   f: A handle to the figure that was created

    %%%%%%%
    % Use the 'figure' command to make sure that the figure in the input
    % exists. The output to figure provides a handle to the figure

    % Use the 'clf' command with the 'reset' option to clean out any
    % existing contents in the figure. Use the figure handle to make sure
    % that the 'clf' command targets this figure
    clf(f, 'reset')

        % Use the 'subplot' command to create the (idx)th subplot axis for
        % plotting. Use the 'Parent' option with the figure handle to make
        % sure that the axes are created in that figure. The output of
        % 'subplot' provides a handle to the axis. Store this this handle
        % as 'ax{idx}'

        % it to apply to
