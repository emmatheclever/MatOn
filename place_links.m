% Inputs:
%
%   links_in_world: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is a matrix
%       whose columns are the start-and-end points of a link in its
%       rotated-but-not-translated frame
%
%   link_end_set_with_base: a 1x(n+1) cell array, each element of which is
%       a vector containing the world location of the end of the
%       corresponding link
%
% Output:
%
%   link_set: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is a 2xn matrix
%       whose columns are the start-and-end points of the link in its
%       after the link has been placed in the world
