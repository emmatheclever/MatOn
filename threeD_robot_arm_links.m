% Take a set of link vectors, joint angles, and joint axes, and return a
% set of matrices for which the columns of each matrix are the endpoints of
% one of the links.
%
% Inputs:
%
%   link_vectors: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is a 2x1 vector
%       describing the vector from the base of the corresponding link to
%       its end
%   joint_angles: a nx1 vector, each element of which is the joint angle
%       preceeding the corresponding link
%   
% Outputs:
%
%   links: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is 2x2 matrix, whose
%       columns are the endpoints of the corresponding link
%
% Additional outputs (These are intermediate variables. Having the option
%   to return them as outputs lets our automatic code checker tell you
%   where problems are in your code):
%
%   R_joints: The rotation matrices associated with the joints
%   R_links: The rotation matrices for the link orientations
%   link_set_local: The link vectors augmented with a zero vector that
%       represents the start of the link
%   link_vectors_in_world: The link vectors in their current orientations
%   links_in_world: The link start and end points in their current
%       orientations
%   link_end_set: The endpoints of the links after taking the cumulative
%       sum of link vectors
